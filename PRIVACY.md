## 1. Introduction  
**SV Techskill** (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù) is developed and maintained by **SV Techskill**. Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your rights and choices.  

This policy applies to information collected via the Project‚Äôs source code repository, project website, published binaries, mobile apps, and related services, unless otherwise stated.  

## 2. Information We Collect  

### 2.1 Information You Provide  
- Contact information (name, email) you provide when you contact us, file an issue, or sign up for mailing lists.  
- Content you submit (issue reports, pull requests, log excerpts, crash reports, screenshots). Do not include sensitive personal data in issues or PRs.  
- Payment information only when using paid services associated with the Project; such data is processed via third-party payment providers and is not stored by us.  

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Information  
- Analytics and usage data (e.g., pages visited on the project website, feature usage telemetry) if enabled.  
- Device and system metadata (OS, app version, IP address, timestamps) used for diagnostics and improving the Project.  
- Cookies and similar technologies on the Project website (see Cookies section).  

### 2.3 Third-Party Data  
- Data collected by third-party services we integrate (e.g., crash reporters, analytics, authentication providers). Those services collect and process data according to their own policies.  

## 3. How We Use Your Information  
We use the information we collect to:  
- Provide, maintain, and improve the Project and related services.  
- Diagnose and fix issues, and analyze usage to help prioritize development.  
- Communicate with you about updates, security advisories, or support requests.  
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our policies.  

We will not use your personal information for other purposes without your consent.  

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure  
We may share information in the following circumstances:  
- **With service providers:** We use third-party vendors (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, payment processors). They act as processors and only process data to provide services to us.  
- **For legal reasons:** When required by law or to respond to lawful requests (e.g., subpoenas), to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Project or others.  
- **Business transfers:** If we reorganize, merge, or sell the Project or its assets, user data may be transferred as part of the transaction.  
- **Aggregated or anonymized data:** We may publish aggregated, non-identifying usage statistics.  

We do not sell personal information.  

## 5. Cookies & Tracking  
Our website may use cookies, local storage, or similar technologies to provide site functionality and analytics. You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings. Third-party services we use may also place cookies; review their privacy policies for details and opt-out options.  

## 6. Third-Party Services  
The Project may integrate third-party services such as:  
- Crash reporting (e.g., Sentry)  
- Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible)  
- Authentication (e.g., OAuth providers)  
- Payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)  

These services have their own privacy policies and may collect data independently. We recommend reviewing their policies before using the Project.  

## 7. Security  
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no system is completely secure. If you become aware of a security incident related to the Project, notify us at **svtechskill@gmail.com** immediately.  

## 8. Data Retention  
We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, to meet legal obligations, and to resolve disputes. Data you post publicly in the repository (issues, PRs, comments) remains public until removed and may be retained in backups and logs.  

## 9. Your Rights & Choices  
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:  
- Accessing the personal data we hold about you.  
- Requesting correction or deletion of your personal data.  
- Objecting to or restricting processing of your data.  
- Withdrawing consent where processing is based on consent.  

To exercise these rights, contact us at **svtechskill@gmail.com**. We may ask for information to verify your identity before responding.  

## 10. Children  
The Project is not intended for children under 13 (or a higher minimum age where required). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us to request deletion.  

## 11. International Transfers  
Data may be processed and stored in countries other than your country of residence. By using the Project or providing data, you consent to such transfer and processing.
